## create-react-app

This project uses the popular
[create-react-app (CRA)](https://create-react-app.dev/) command to setup a
modern React application. This way we can focus on the code itself, and not
worry about configuring many build tools.

The
[package.json](https://github.com/AlterClassIO/react-flix-challenge/blob/main/package.json)
file provides four scripts:

- `start`: Runs the app in the development mode.
- `build`: Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly
  bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best
  performance.
- `test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
- `eject`: Remove create-react-app build dependency from your project.
